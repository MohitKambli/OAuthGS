### Backend Setup

Navigate to the backend folder where the Scala application is located:

`
cd backend
`

Use SBT to build/compile the backend using the following command in the terminal :

`
sbt clean compile
`

Once compiled, run the backend using the following command:

`
sbt run
`

The backend should now be running on http://localhost:8080.
