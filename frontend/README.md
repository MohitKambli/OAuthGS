### Frontend Setup

Navigate to the frontend folder where the React.js application is located:

`
cd frontend
`

Install the necessary Node.js dependencies using npm or yarn:

`
npm install
OR
yarn install
`

Once everything is set up, start the React development server:

`
npm start
OR
yarn start
`

The frontend should now be running on http://localhost:3000.
